# ✅ COMPLETE: Anime Store Scraping to Firebase

## What's Done ✅

1. **Configured scraper** to fetch 5 pages from anime-store.jp
2. **Updated products API** to fetch from Firebase Firestore
3. **Modified frontend** to display database products
4. **Created test scripts** for easy scraping

---

## 🎯 How to Use (Simple 3 Steps)

### Step 1: Make sure your dev server is running

```bash
cd /home/priyansh/japan-haul/frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Run the scrape command (in a NEW terminal)

```bash
cd /home/priyansh/japan-haul/frontend
chmod +x scrape-anime-store.sh
./scrape-anime-store.sh
```

**OR** use curl directly:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cron/scrape \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer test-secret-for-local-development-change-in-production" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sites": ["animeStore"], "pagesPerSite": 5}'
```

### Step 3: View your products!

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000/en/products
- **Admin Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000/en/admin/scraping  
- **Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/ec-animetourism-b5c25/firestore

---

## 📊 What You'll Get

- **~100-150 products** from 5 pages of anime-store.jp
- **Real product data** with:
  - Product titles
  - Prices
  - Images
  - Availability status
  - Source URLs
- **Stored in Firebase** Firestore database
- **Auto-displayed** on your frontend

---

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### 1. Updated Cron Scraper (`src/app/api/cron/scrape/route.ts`)
- Changed anime store from 2 pages to use `pagesPerSite` parameter
- Now supports scraping 5+ pages

### 2. Updated Products Data (`src/app/_data/products.ts`)
- Changed `getAllProducts()` to fetch from Firebase database
- Uses `/api/products/db` endpoint instead of in-memory cache
- Transforms database products to match frontend Product type
- Falls back to hardcoded products if database is empty

### 3. Added Environment Variable (`.env.local`)
```bash
CRON_SECRET=test-secret-for-local-development-change-in-production
```

### 4. New Files Created
- `scrape-anime-store.sh` - Quick scraping script
- `ANIME_STORE_SCRAPE.md` - Step-by-step guide
- `COMPLETE_SETUP.md` - This file

## 🎨 Frontend Integration

Your products page (`/en/products`) now:

1. **Fetches from Firebase** on page load
2. **Caches for 5 minutes** (reduces database reads)
3. **Shows real products** instead of hardcoded ones
4. **Falls back gracefully** if database is empty

No code changes needed in your React components - they automatically work with the new data source!
